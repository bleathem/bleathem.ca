      <description>JBoss Developer Framework   The JBoss JDF project shows Java EE developers how to build state-of-the-art applications using the JBoss implementations of the Java EE stack. Specifically, the JDF View Frameworks section identifies a number of alternative approaches one can take when developing the view layer of your application. We in the RichFaces project have been working towards better supporting this effort by redesigning our JSF component architecture to allow the javascript part of our components (what we call our &amp;ldquo;widgets&amp;rdquo;) to be used independent of JSF, either in a standalone manner or coupled with another web framework.</description>

      <title>ViewAccessScope - why it&#39;s useful</title>

      <description>At first the conversation scope introduced with CDI seemed like it would be incredibly useful. Unfortunately, working with conversations ended up being more difficult than expected. Details of why this is, is fodder for another post.
I ended up often using the JSF ViewScope, exposed as a CDI scope though the Seam Faces CDI extension. When used in conjunction with JSF viewParams to propagate information between pages, the result is a book-markable end user experience.</description>

      <title>CDI does events too!</title>

      <description>CDI is the new programming model introduced with Java EE 6. An acronym for Contexts and Dependency Injection, CDI advertises well two of the programming paradigms it aims to solve. But there is another, often overlooked sibling: Event handling. While I&amp;rsquo;d heard it mentioned in the context of CDI, I&amp;rsquo;d never really paid much attention - I was probably too busy trying to wrap my head around Conversations, and how CDI provides Dependency Injection.</description>
