      <description>It&amp;#8217;s feedback time! Developers today are presented with an abundance of options when selecting which technologies will form the basis of their applications. Even if we constrain ourselves to the presentation tier, that choices available are staggering. Technology providers then get to play the fun game of anticipating in which direction its users and customers are headed and make sure they are providing them with value.
