      <description>JAX Conf 2012   RichFaces represented at the &amp;ldquo;2012 JAX conference&amp;rdquo;:http://jaxconf.com/2012/ in San Francisco this week. I presented three times on two JSF topics. The conference was overall a great success in my opinion - while not the most highly attended conference at which I&amp;rsquo;ve presented, those that attended were highly engaged and happy to have such direct access to the speakers.
Indeed this was one of my preferred aspects to JAX conf.</description>

      <description>I just returned from an excellent trip to the &amp;ldquo;Red Hat Summit/JBoss World&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/ in Boston. The event was fantastic, kicking off with a great &amp;ldquo;keynote&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/keynotes-sessions.html#12345 demoing &amp;ldquo;Drools&amp;rdquo;:http://www.jboss.org/drools/ in a Mobile scenario. Following the keynote were a number of great sessions, including one I presented on the topic of &amp;ldquo;Mobile RichFaces Applications&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#187.
The session was well received, with some good discussion afterwards. In the session I motivated mobile web applications as a must-have in today&amp;rsquo;s market - users&amp;rsquo; will want and expect a functional web application even if your native application is better.</description>
