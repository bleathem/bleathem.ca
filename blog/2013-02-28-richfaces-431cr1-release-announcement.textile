The first candidate release of RichFaces 4.3 ("4.3.0.CR1":https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12320379) has been released.  This micro release addresses some bugs present in the "RichFaces 4.3.0.Final release":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2013/02/richfaces-430final-release-announcement.html, and offers some improvements on the new features introduced in that same release.  Have a look at the "4.3.1.CR1 Release Notes":https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12320558 for a complete listing of what has been included in this release.

div(alert alert-info). *To try out this release:* You can download the distribution "directly":http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones, or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.3.1.CR1. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our<a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces4x"> getting started guide</a>.

h3. Concurrent testing efforts

Normally we leave RichFaces releases in our "Nexus staging server":https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/staging/ until the "RichFaces QE":http://blog.pavol.pitonak.com/2012/09/meet-richfaces-qe-team.html team has fully verified the release.  With this release however, we are trying something new.

We have promoted the RichFaces 4.3.1.CR1 artifacts out of staging having only undergone a "_smoke test_":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing.  In this way we are enabling the community to try out the latest fixes concurrent to our execution of our extensive automated test suite, and the remainder of our QA process.

div(alert alert-warning). So *please do* take this candidate release out for a spin, and "report any issues":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF you uncover so we can address them before the 4.3.0.Final release.
