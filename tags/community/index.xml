      <description>RichFaces   RichFaces 4.2.3.Final has been released. This Final release is a re-tag of the 4.2.3.CR1 release as no blocking issues were found by either our QE team, nor by the community.
The RichFaces 4.2.3.Final release is purely a bug-fix release, with a focus on compatibility between RichFaces and the JBoss Portlet Bridge. I&amp;rsquo;ll refer you to the RichFaces 4.2.3.CR1 release blog for details of the release, with a special highlight paid to the contributions from the JBoss Portal Bridge team, and contributions from community members.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Seam 3 Community hack night is centered around Seam Faces. This is a great chance to mingle with some CDI/JSF developers on IRC, and get your fingerprint into the Seam Faces DNA! Whether you have your own itch you want to scratch, a long-standing bug you want to see resolved, or implement a new feature altogether, we&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of low hanging fruit ripe for the picking!
In preparation for the hack-a-thon, I&amp;rsquo;ve given the Seam Faces JIRA issues a once-over.</description>
