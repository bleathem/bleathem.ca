The first candidate release of RichFaces 4.3 ("4.3.0.CR1":https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12320379) has been released.  This micro release addresses some bugs present on the "RichFaces 4.3.0.Final release":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2013/02/richfaces-430final-release-announcement.html, and offers some improvements on the new features introduced in that same release.  Have a look at the "4.3.1.CR1 Release Notes":https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12320558 for a complete listing if what was included in this release.

h3. Release Highligths

Perhaps the most significant change introduced in this release is isses "RF-12803":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-12803, where we've included the @<a4j:ajax>@ "JavaScript service extension":http://alexsmirnov.wordpress.com/2011/03/24/richfaces-javascript-service/ in @<f:ajax>@ execution.  This service allows RichFaces components to serve and excute JavaScript after the page content is lower, leading to improved page performance.  As we've continued to use this service more extensively throughout our components, we realized we had to integrate the extension with the JSF 2 @<f:ajax>@ behavior, or we would forever be reminding people to use @<a4j:ajax>@ instead (which you should be using anyway for all sorts of "additional reasons":http://mkblog.exadel.com/2010/08/what-richfaces-a4jajax-adds-on-top-jsf-2-fajax-tag/).

The RichFaces push component has been upgraded to use the latest release of the (awesome!) "Atmosphere library":http://async-io.org/, with the resolution of "RF-12689":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-12689.  If you haven't yet started using the easy-to-use RichFaces push component in your application (with optional CDI and JMS integration) be sure to follow these "4 simple steps for RichFaces Push":http://rik-ansikter.blogspot.ca/2012/02/configuring-richfaces-push-with-42.html.

h3. Moving forward

We'll let RichFaces 4.3.0.CR1 bake in the community for a few weeks.  Take it for a spin, and "report any regressions":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF you should come across that our "top-notch QE team":http://blog.pavol.pitonak.com/2012/09/meet-richfaces-qe-team.html might have overlooked.  Hopefully we can have a final release out by the end of the month.
