# Patternfly Roadmap Update

crosspost from: https://blog.patternfly.org/patternfly-roadmap-update/

Last November we published the
https://blog.patternfly.org/the-patternfly-roadmap/[PatternFly
roadmap] where we put forward the idea for PatternFly 4 and 5, an effort
around web components, and a CSS rewrite. Alpha releases for
https://blog.patternfly.org/patternfly-4-0-0-alpha-2-release/[PatternFly
4] and https://blog.patternfly.org/web-component-0-0-8-alpha/[PatternFly
Web Components] delivered initial progress on these efforts. However,
the story has grown more complex with the introduction of
https://blog.patternfly.org/patternfly-angular-2-and-react-repos[additional
PatternFly framework repositories]. In this post we will provide a
status update on our delivery of our roadmap, and explain how all these
repositories and future versions tie together.

[[the-big-picture]]

## The Big Picture

The PatternFly design system consists of:

1.  A set of patterns for use in enterprise applications
2.  A CSS implementation of the patterns’ visuals
3.  JS implementations of the patterns’ behaviours

Implementations of the behaviours are offered via multiple framework
integrations (Angular, React, and jQuery) to enable more code reuse and
increase developer productivity. We are positioning web components as
our vehicle for code reuse between our framework integrations, as
described in a previous
https://blog.patternfly.org/web-component-0-0-8-alpha/[PatternFly Web
Component post].

[[independent-releases]]
## Independent releases

Each of the PatternFly repositories will move forward with an
independent release cycle and version (following http://semver.org).
This is in contrast with the version lock we’ve had to date between
PatternFly and Angular-PatternFly.

[[angular-patternfly-4]]
## Angular-PatternFly 4

Taking advantage of this break in the PatternFly/Angular-PatternFly
version lock, we have released
https://github.com/patternfly/angular-patternfly/releases/tag/v4.0.0[Angular-PatternFly
4.0.0]. Refer to the release notes fro complete details, but the major
deliverables of this release are:

* A port of the Angular directives to Angular 1.5+ components
* The jQuery dependency is now optional
* A major ui-bootstrap dependency update
* A number of new component implementations

Angular-Patternfly 4.0.0 relies on version 3.25.0 of PatternFly..

[[patternfly-4]]
## PatternFly 4

The changes introduced to date in the Patternfly 4 Alpha and RC’s did
not warrant a major version bump. As such those changes were merged back
into the master branch, and delivered as PatternFly 3.25.0.

We will move forward with a PatternFly 4 effort centered around
splitting the CSS and jQuery implementations into separate repositories
to be consistent with our model of PatternFly presented above. This will
facilitate uses cases that consume PatternFly CSS but don’t want to
bring in the jQuery implementations, such as the various framework
integrations.

PatternFly will also move to a continuous release process, rather than
the current sprint-based release cycle. A release will be triggered with
every PR merge to master, applying semantic versioning as appropriate.
This will make it easier for downstream to consume PatternFly changes in
a timely manner.

[[framework-repositories]]
## Framework Repositories

PatternFly Web Components and PatternFly React have initial releases and
will move forward with a continuous release process. Look for a
PatternFly-ng release soon.

[[patternfly-css]]
## PatternFly CSS

What we initially called “PatternFly 5” is being carried out in the
PatternFly-CSS repository.  It consists of a rewrite of our CSS based on
Bootstrap 4. Check out the
http://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-css/[PatternFly-CSS component
showcase] to follow along with progress. When this new CSS
implementation is ready, it will replace the current CSS implementation.
