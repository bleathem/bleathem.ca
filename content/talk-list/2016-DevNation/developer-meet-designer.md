This presentation will take developers behind the scenes of the Keynote Demo to showcase how designers and a developers work together to achieve outstanding results. In this presentation, we'll identify the gap between designers and developers, and walk you through an actual example of how to build bridges that increase trust in your products. You'll learn about: - UX basics - Design within open source communities - Understanding the problems between developers and designers - The advantages (and disadvantages) of working with a designer - Coping with common pitfalls and false assumptions - Specific CSS and JS techniques used during the Keynote demo visualization You'll leave knowing that UX goes beyond the UI, with a better understanding of why working with a designer is important, and how to work together successfully.
