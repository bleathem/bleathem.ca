We have a second candidate release for RichFaces 4.5 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12325841[4.5.0.CR2]) available.  We've fixed a couple of regressions uncovered by both our community and QA team.  Thanks guys!  Read on for the specifics of what was fixed in this release.

[.alert.alert-info]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.5.0.CR2.

*Compatibility with RichFaces 4.3:* RichFaces 4.5 is intended to be backwards compatibility with RichFaces 4.3 and should be a drop in replacement into your applications, requiring only changes in your pom.xml.

Any breaking changes with RichFaces 4.5 are being tracked in our GitHub wiki https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/wiki/Migration-from-RichFaces-4-to-RichFaces-4.5[migration page].  Please update that wiki page with a Pull Request if you find any incompatibilities.
