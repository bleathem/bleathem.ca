      <description>JAX Conf 2012   RichFaces represented at the &amp;ldquo;2012 JAX conference&amp;rdquo;:http://jaxconf.com/2012/ in San Francisco this week. I presented three times on two JSF topics. The conference was overall a great success in my opinion - while not the most highly attended conference at which I&amp;rsquo;ve presented, those that attended were highly engaged and happy to have such direct access to the speakers.
Indeed this was one of my preferred aspects to JAX conf.</description>
