The first beta release of RichFaces 4.5 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12324941[4.5.0.Beta1]) is now available.  This full framework release incorporates a number of library upgrades as well as some new features for existing components.  Read below for a summary of the issues resolved, and stay tuned for further posts going into the improvements in detail.

[.alert.alert-info]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.5.0.Beta1. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces4x[getting started guide].

== Release Highlights
Significant improvements in this RichFaces 4.5.0.Beta1 release include:

* Big update to RichFaces push with the upgrade of Atmosphere to 2.2.0
* DataTable component gets built-in sorting and filtering
* Select component gets autcomplete functionality (for autocompleting on object selection)
* jQuery upgrade to 1.11.1
* Google Guava updated to 17.0
* Showcase gets automated functional tests

=== Atmosphere upgrade to 2.2.0
While Atmosphere 2.2.0 supports websockets out-of-the box, however the RichFaces push component configuration still uses long-polling.  This issue (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-13787[RF-13787]) has already been resolved and will be available in the upcoming https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12325456[4.5.0.Beta2] release.

=== Built-in sorting and filtering of the DataTable
The built-in sorting and filtering capabilities of the ExtendedDataTable have been ported to the simpler DataTable component.  As with the ExtendedDataTable, you'll have to disable the built-in sorting and filtering controls if you instead want to use custom controls.  For further details refer to the RichFaces http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_4_X/Component_Reference/en-US/html/chap-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids.html#sect-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids-Table_filtering[Component Reference] for additional details on using the built-in and external filter controls.

[.alert.alert-warning]
Control over the filter controls can be achieved by setting the @filterType=custom@ attribute, and implementing your own filter controls in the back-end.  Built-in filter controls can be disabled altogether by setting the web.xml context param @org.richfaces.builtin.filter.enabled@ to _false_.

=== Autocompleting with the Select component
With the initial release of RichFaces 4, the Autcomplete component was re-designed to target only text-based use cases.  It was felt that object selection use cases were better served by the Select component.  However the Select component lacked the autocompleting capability to round out this story.  Until now!

With RichFaces 4.5.0.Beta2 we've ported the autocomplete capabilities from the Autocomplete component to the Select component.  Using a similar syntax as with the Autocomplete, you can now dynamically populate the Select components options list via ajax.  Refer to the http://showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=select&skin=blueSky[showcase] for an example of how this works.
