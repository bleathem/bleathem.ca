      <description>RichFaces   RichFaces 4.2.3.Final has been released. This Final release is a re-tag of the 4.2.3.CR1 release as no blocking issues were found by either our QE team, nor by the community.
The RichFaces 4.2.3.Final release is purely a bug-fix release, with a focus on compatibility between RichFaces and the JBoss Portlet Bridge. I&amp;rsquo;ll refer you to the RichFaces 4.2.3.CR1 release blog for details of the release, with a special highlight paid to the contributions from the JBoss Portal Bridge team, and contributions from community members.</description>
