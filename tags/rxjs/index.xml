This analogy was very well described by @jhusain his Async Javascript at Netflix talk that initially got me excited about Reactive Functional programming. My contribution to this idea is to present it in a visual way.
 To visualize both a &#34;regular&#34; collection, as well as a collection-in-time, I used the d3.</description>
