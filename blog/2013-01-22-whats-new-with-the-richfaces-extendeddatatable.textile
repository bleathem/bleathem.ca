The "upcoming 4.3 release":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12320380 of RichFaces will offer the RichFaces community a number of improvements to the extendedDataTable.  These new features include:

* Built-in sorting and filtering
* External table state saving
* A number of bug-fixes

h3. Built-in sorting and filtering

The RichFaces 4 "extendedDataTable":showcase.richfaces.org/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=extendedDataTable (EDT) has always had the ability to sort and filter columns, but required the developer to define the sort and filter controls themselves, then manually invoke the required operations on the back-end.  While not difficult to do, a lot of boiler-plate code was required for what is in fact a common operation.  With RichFaces 4.3 we've resolved "RF-8125":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-8125 that tracked a long standing request to port the built-in search capabilities form the RichFaces 3 EDT to RichFaces 4.

div(alert alert-info). *Built-in sorting/filtering is currently only available in the extendedDataTable component.*  We will add support to the dataTable component in a subsequent release.

h4. Built-in Sorting

Implementing sortable columns in the EDT is now as simple as adding the @sortBy@ attribute to your EDT column, and the sort controls will automatically be generated and linked to the internal sorting mechanism.  To influence how the sorting is performed, add the @comparator@ attribute to your column, and the comparator defined there will be used for the sort.

Refer to the RichFaces 4 "Component Reference":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/Component_Reference/en-US/html/chap-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids.html#sect-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids-Table_sorting for additional details on using the built-in and external sort controls.

div(alert alert-warning). If you require additional flexibility, and prefer to implement your own sort controls, set the @sortType=custom@ attribute, and the built-in sort controls will not be rendered.  Built-in sort controls can be disabled altogether by setting the web.xml context param @org.richfaces.builtin.sort.enabled@ to _false_.

h4. Built-in Filtering

Similarly, taking advantage of the built-in filter controls is also straightforward.  Define the @filterValue@ attribute on the column to be filtered, then define either a @filterExpression@ or @filter@ attribute to implement the filter logic.  When the attributes are present an input element will be displayed in the column header.  Simple value conversions are performed implicitly in the EL of the @filterExpression@ or explicitly in the @filter@ implementation.

Refer to the RichFaces 4 "Component Reference":http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/4.3.X/4.3.0.CR1/Component_Reference/en-US/html/chap-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids.html#sect-Component_Reference-Tables_and_grids-Table_filtering for additional details on using the built-in and external filter controls.

div(alert alert-warning). Further control over the filter controls can be achieved by setting the @filterType=custom@ attribute, and implementing your own filter controls in the back-end.  Built-in filter controls can be disabled altogether by setting the web.xml context param @org.richfaces.builtin.filter.enabled@ to _false_.

h3. ExtendedDataTable State Saving

The EDT has had another RichFaces 3 feature ported forward: table state saving.  With the resolution of "RF-10442":https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-10442, application developers can add the @tableState@ attribute to their EDT components, providing a value-binding to a bean String property that can be used to store the state of the column width, sequence, sorting, and filtering of the EDT.  The table state is stored in a JSON string format, and is easily stored in a data base for later retrieval.

h3. Bug fixes

In addition to the above feature additions, the EDT has seen a number of bug fixes in the 4.3 release.  These fixes include:
