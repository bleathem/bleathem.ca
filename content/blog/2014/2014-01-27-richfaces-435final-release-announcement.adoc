== Moving forward

You will likely have noticed no mention of JSF 2.2 in this announcement.  We are not at this time introducing JSF 2.2 support into our stable branch, but are rather doing so in the upcoming https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12322162[5.0.0.Alpha3] release of RichFaces.  https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=331&view=planning&quickFilter=1081[Progress on RichFaces 5] has continued while we prepared the 4.3.5 release, and we have already committed a number of JSF 2.2 related fixes.  Look for this release in the next week or two.
