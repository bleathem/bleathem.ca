[.alert.alert-info]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 5.0.0.Alpha3. For more information on setting up a RichFaces application, refer to our http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces5x[getting started guide].

== Release Notes

This release does not provide any new components, but rather focuses on JSF 2.2 compatibility.  Looking through the issues resolved you can see both a number of component specific fixes as well as some framework "core" fixes.

[.alert]
*Note:* While this release adds support for JSF 2.2, you are still free to use RichFaces 5 with JSF 2.1
