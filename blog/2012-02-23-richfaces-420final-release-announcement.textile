Richfaces <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12318970">4.2.0.Final</a> is now available for download! A quick follow on to our <a href="http://blog.bleathem.ca/2011/12/richfaces-410final-release-announcement.html">4.1 release</a>, Richfaces 4.2 delivers some “missing” components migrated from RichFaces 3, and provides usability and API improvements for resource loading optimizations and the push API. Documentation was a huge effort for this release; we are delivering an updated and complete <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_4_X/vdldoc/">VDL taglib doc</a>, along with our more well established <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_4_X/Developer_Guide/">Developer Guide</a>, and <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_4_X/Component_Reference/">Components Reference</a>.

To try out this release, you can download the distribution <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/stable">directly</a>, or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.2.0.Final. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces4x">getting started guide</a>.

h3. Looking Ahead

It’s now time to buckle down and focus on 4.3/4.Future efforts. The themes we will be focusing on are narrowing down to:

* Continued improvement of the RF 4 core components
** Further feature migration from RichFaces 3 (as required)
** Bug fixes, performance enhancements
* <a href="https://community.jboss.org/thread/177821">A re-work of our testing infrastructure</a>
** Bridge the gap between what we do to test our framework, and what devs do testing their applications
* <a href="https://community.jboss.org/thread/177406">A new set of components</a>
** Improving our turnaround time, by leveraging existing javascript “widgets”

* CDK improvements
** Further simplifying the process for creating new components, while improving the turnaround time of component development
