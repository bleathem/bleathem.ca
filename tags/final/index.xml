      <description>RichFaces   RichFaces 4.2.3.Final has been released. This Final release is a re-tag of the 4.2.3.CR1 release as no blocking issues were found by either our QE team, nor by the community.
The RichFaces 4.2.3.Final release is purely a bug-fix release, with a focus on compatibility between RichFaces and the JBoss Portlet Bridge. I&amp;rsquo;ll refer you to the RichFaces 4.2.3.CR1 release blog for details of the release, with a special highlight paid to the contributions from the JBoss Portal Bridge team, and contributions from community members.</description>

      <description>RichFaces4.2.2.Final is available, the second RichFaces 4.2 micro release. This release was originally intended to focus on changes required to better align with the upcoming JBoss AS 7.1.2 release. However we had some community members step forward with some fixes, and those contributions ended up turning this release into a reasonable bug fix release!
I would like to give a big shout out to Luca Nardelli, Adrian Gonzalez, and Jason Porter.</description>

      <description>Richfaces 4.2.0.Final is now available for download! A quick follow on to our 4.1 release, Richfaces 4.2 delivers some “missing” components migrated from RichFaces 3, and provides usability and API improvements for resource loading optimizations and the push API. Documentation was a huge effort for this release; we are delivering an updated and complete VDL taglib doc, along with our more well established Developer Guide, and Components Reference.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to announce the release of RichFaces 4.1.0.Final. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long road from 4.0 to 4.1, with a significant train of milestone releases along the way. The journey was worth it though, with a significant 4.1 release building on top of the successful 4.0.0.Final release, providing: additional components migrated from the RichFaces 3 component set, altogether new components, and significant enhancements to the framework feature set.</description>
