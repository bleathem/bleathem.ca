I am excited to announce the release of https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12320296[RichFaces 5.0.0.Alpha1].  While RichFaces 5.0.0.Alpha1 is an incredibly significant release (with almost all aspects of the framework seeing some changes) the release is in fact functionally equivalent to RichFaces 4.3.2.Final.  So go ahead an try it out, and give us https://community.jboss.org/en/richfaces?view=discussions[your feedback]!

[role="alert alert-info"]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/stable[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 5.0.0.Alpha1. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 5 application, refer to our https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces#getting-started[getting started guide].

== Release highlights
The primary goals for RichFaces 5.0.0.Alpha1 were as follows:

* <<build>>
* <<namespaces>>
* <<testing>>
* <<asciidoc>>

Read a summary of each of these changes below, with links to blogs containing additional details.

[[build]]
== Re-structure the build

The original design goal of the RichFaces 4 build was to enable partial builds of the framework to reduce the developer turnaround time in developing new components.  While this breaking apart of the build into pieces was an attractive idea on paper, it didn't work out that well in practice.  The cost of assembling the partial build artifacts into the distributed framework was too high, and the various partial builds turned out to be more inter-dependent than expected.

With the http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2013/02/richfaces-430final-release-announcement.html[4.3.0.Final release] of the RichFaces CDK we introduced an https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-8287[incremental build feature] that removed the need for these partial builds.  With this incremental build we could now build the framework in a piecewise manner, without requiring the framework to be segmented into partial builds.  This led us to re-engineer the build based on current requirements and use cases, and was one of the primary motivating factors for RichFaces 5.

The end result is a build structure now contained within a https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces[single repository] that is easier for both newcomers and seasoned RichFaces developers to grok.  We hope this will encourage more community members to dive into the source code and contribute to the success of the framework.  Should you still need to work with the RichFaces 4 source, it is available in the separate https://github.com/richfaces4[RichFaces 4 GitHub "organization"]

[[namespaces]]
== Collapse the +rich:+ and +a4j:+ namespaces

As you may know, the current RichFaces framework is built from the old http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax4jsf[Ajax4Jsf] project, and the original RichFaces component set.  This distinction of the libraries has been preserved in the RichFaces framework with the use of the +rich:+ and +a4j:+ namespaces.  However this distinction has blurred over time, and has unfortunately become a barrier to adoption for new RichFaces users.

In RichFaces 5, starting with this Alpha1 release, we are collapsing the namespaces into the single +r:+ namespace.  This will ease adoption for new developers, and allow for a more intuitive tooling experience within your IDE.

[label label-info]#Blog# Read more about the namespace change, and how to automate the migration of your own applications to use the the new namespace in the http://lukas.fryc.eu/blog/2013/06/richfaces-build-restructure.html#_namespaces[Namespace section of the Build Re-Structure blog].

[role="alert alert-info"]
The http://showcase5-richfaces.rhcloud.com/[RichFaces 5 Showcase] has been updated to reflect the simplified showcase.

== Framework distribution simplification

Incorporating RichFaces into your applications is easier with RichFaces 5.  We now distribute a single +richfaces.jar+.  No more separate API/UI/Impl jars, and no more BOM!  If you are using maven, simply add the RichFaces jar to your project as in:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.richfaces</groupId>
    <artifactId>richfaces</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0.Alpha1</version>
</dependency>

[[testing]]
== Improvements to testing

Testing has always been a primary concern of the RichFaces project.  In RichFaces 5 we have taken our testing efforts to the next level with the incorporation of the https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQGRA2/Home[Arquillian Graphene] and https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-warp/blob/master/README.md[Arquillian Warp] extensions.

[label label-info]#Blog# Read how you can use these tools yourself to test your JSF applications with this http://lukas.fryc.eu/blog/tags/testing-jsf/[blog series on testing JSF].

[[asciidoc]]
== Move to asciidoc for our documentation

Last but not least I'll mention the improvements we've made to our documentation workflow.  Docs for RichFaces have always been a big part of the project.  However we recently started to notice we had a large barrier for doc contributions that were anything more substantial than minor edits and small additions.  This was due to the manual/direct editing of the Docbook XML source.  XML is simply not conducive to an efficient authorship workflow.

In RichFaces 5.0.0.Alpha1 we have incorporated AsciiDoc into the top of our existing Docbook tool-chain.  This has dramatically improved our documentation contribution workflow without compromising any flexibility nor expressibility.  The http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_5_X/[RichFaces 5 docs] are already quite more accessible than the http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/latest_4_X/[RichFaces 4] ones, and we've only just begun to re-vamp the content.

[label label-info]#Blog# Read more about our move to AsciiDoc in this blog post http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2013/06/richfaces-moves-to-asciidoc.html[RichFaces moves to AsciiDoc].

== Next Steps

With these high-impact (yet mundane) changes behind us, we are excited to move forward with RichFaces 5 development.  We've already started laying out our https://issues.jboss.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=331[RichFaces 5.0.0.Alpha2 sprints] as we execute on our https://community.jboss.org/message/822732[RichFaces 5 Road Map].  Next up is https://bootstrap-richfaces.rhcloud.com/[LESS/Bootstrap integration], and incorporation of our https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces-widgets[standalone javascript widgets].
