We have a first candidate release for RichFaces 4.5 (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12325588[4.5.0.CR1]) available.  With this candidate release we've further improved our stability over our beta releases, with a special focus on backwards compatibility with RichFaces 4.3.  Read below for details of what is included in this release.

[.alert.alert-info]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.5.0.CR1. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces#getting-started[getting started guide].

== Compatibility with RichFaces 4.3
RichFaces 4.5 is a significant release introducing many changes to the framework.  However with all these changes maintaining backwards compatibility with RichFaces 4.3 has been a priority.  As such, RichFaces 4.5 should be a drop in replacement into your applications, provided you make the necessary changes in your pom.xml.

Any breaking changes with RichFaces 4.5 are being tracked in our GitHub wiki https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/wiki/Migration-from-RichFaces-4-to-RichFaces-4.5[migration page].  Please update that wiki page with a Pull Request if you find any incompatibilities.
