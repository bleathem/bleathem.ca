The mobile web is a hot topic as many developers are curious about how they can tap into this market while leveraging their existing skill-sets and technology investments. The good news is that as a JavaServer Faces (JSF) developer, you can make your application mobile by taking advantage of the mobile-compatible components and other framework improvements introduced in RichFaces 4.1.

In this session, Brian Leathem, RichFaces project lead, will use the RichFaces Mobile Showcase as a case study to demonstrate best practices in making RichFaces applications mobile compatible. This Showcase is one of Red Hat’s most widely viewed public demos with ~50,000 hits per month and is deployed on Red Hat’s PaaS offering, OpenShift.

Brian will also explain how to overcome obstacles of existing desktop-based frameworks (like JSF) by using capabilities available with HTML5. He will discuss the mobile web’s “single page” programming model and how attendees can convert any existing web app to work on mobile devices. And throughout the session, Brian will answer some of the many questions that must be addressed when taking any web application mobile, including:

- How do I support my application across browser and across device?
- How can I leverage HTML5 features with my existing application?
- Which JavaScript framework should I use?
- How does HTML5 tie back into my enterprise infrastructure?
