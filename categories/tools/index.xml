      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of moving from svn to a distributed version control system (dvcs) for a long time. I held back, hoping the mercurial (hg) vs. git &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; would declare a winner, but as major projects started adopting the two dvcs&amp;rsquo;s, it became apparent to me that neither tool was going to disappear anytime soon. This notion was cemented for me when I read a forum post saying hg = git &amp;gt;&amp;gt; svnThat settled it.</description>
