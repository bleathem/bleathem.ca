== Moving forward

We are finishing off work on our https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12324013[RichFaces 4.5 release] to address JSF 2.2 compatibility with the RichFaces 4.x branch.  This has necessitated we put RichFaces 5 development on hold, but we feel will be worth it to get JSF 2.2 support in a stable release sooner rather than later.
