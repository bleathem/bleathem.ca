      <description>RichFaces   With the imminent 4.3.0.Final release of RichFaces, we will be providing developers with the ability to dynamically create &amp;lt;rich:togglePanel&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rich:accordion&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;rich:tabPanel&amp;gt; panel items dynamically with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag.
&amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; vs. &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; Creating the above panels from a backing bean list has always been possible with RichFaces 4 using the JSTL &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; tag, so why have we bothered adding support for creating such panels with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag?</description>
