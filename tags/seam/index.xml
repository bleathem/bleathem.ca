      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Seam 3 Community hack night is centered around Seam Faces. This is a great chance to mingle with some CDI/JSF developers on IRC, and get your fingerprint into the Seam Faces DNA! Whether you have your own itch you want to scratch, a long-standing bug you want to see resolved, or implement a new feature altogether, we&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of low hanging fruit ripe for the picking!
In preparation for the hack-a-thon, I&amp;rsquo;ve given the Seam Faces JIRA issues a once-over.</description>

      <description>(cross posted from :http://community.jboss.org/people/bleathem/blog/2011/06/20/seam-faces-302final-released)
Great news, Seam Faces 3.0.2.Final has been released! It is available for download via the JBoss Nexus repository. Primarily a bug fix release, Seam Faces 3.0.2.Final resolves some compatibility issues with MyFaces, thanks to contributions from Christian Kaltepoth. Additionally, José Freitas has contributed some fixes to issues with the UIInputContainer. A full list of the bugs fixed is available here.
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about the community involvement in this release, and with more community members coming forward with features they&amp;rsquo;d like to see implemented/improved.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post, as I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a significant career change. I am now working for Red Hat, as a core developer on the RichFaces project. I am also representing Red hat on the JSR-344: JSF 2.2 Expert Group, and will continue in my role as Seam Faces module lead.
As such, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting at JAXConf/JSF Summit on the topic of Seam Faces. I really like this presentation, as I not only go into the features provided by Seam Faces, but I show how some of those features are implemented taking advantage of the platform extension points built into CDI and JSF.</description>

      <title>Seam Module Spotlight: Seam Faces</title>

      <description>This is a blog entry I wrote for in.relation.to. I&amp;rsquo;m including it here to keep a personal record of the post.
In this entry for the Seam Module Spotlight series, we will take a close look at the “view configuration” feature of Seam Faces.
Seam Faces aims to provide JSF developers with a truly worthy framework for web development by ironing out some of JSF’s pain points, integrating tightly with CDI, and offering out of the box integration with the other Seam Modules and third party libraries.</description>

      <title>View Configuration with Seam 3 Faces - the Introduction</title>

      <description>In Seam Faces we&amp;rsquo;ve provided JSF developers with a mechanism to centrally configure various aspects of their JSF views. Concerns like transaction control and view security are currently supported, and support for URL rewriting, XSRF attack prevention, and JSF navigation is in the planning stage.
The end-goal is to support view configuration via multiple sources (including some support for &amp;lt;f:metadata&amp;gt; child tags). For now we provide type-safe configuration using annotations on enums.</description>
