= Next steps
Work on RichFaces 4.5.0.CR1 is currently underway.  However, API compatibility with RichFaces 4.3 is a top-priority with us for this release (making migrations as easy as possible).  As such we may squeeze in a 4.5.0.Beta3 release to ensure we get a 4.5 release that is fully compatible with 4.3.  We'll make this decision as we get close to our next milestone release.
