Last week at "Java One":http://www.oracle.com/javaone/ I presented a session with "Lincoln Baxter III":https://twitter.com/lincolnthree on the topic of _"Testing JSF Applications with Arquillian and Selenium":https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7622_.  The material for the presentation is available:

- Slide deck := "http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/testing-jsf.html":http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/testing-jsf.html

- Sample source code := "https://github.com/bleathem/TestingJSF":https://github.com/bleathem/TestingJSF

While at the conference, I also presented a pair of presentations at the "JBoss Booth":http://www.jboss.org/events/javaone/sessions.  There were trimmed down version of the presentations I gave earlier this summer at "JAX 2012":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html.  These booth presentation were recorded, staty tuned for links to the videos on youtube.  Slides for these presentations are available at:

- Mobile JSF with RichFaces := "http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html
- Leverage jQuery plugins to create JSF Components := "http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html

Overall the conference was a great success.  It was prticularly fun re-uniting with fellow re-mote co-workers for some face-to-face time.  The shared accomodations at the "JBoss houses" worked out well here, with many a late night discussion around the kitchen table.

Of course one can't mention JavaOne without talking about the "Oracle Appreciation Event":http://www.oracle.com/us/appreciation-event-experience-1734940.html.  Words cannot express how _supremely awesome_ it was to see Pearl Jam perform live!  Larry Ellison's going to have a tough time topping that next year!

After a busy week at the conference, it was extremely relaxing to sit on
