      <description>This week I attended the JAXConf 2013 conference for a third year in a row. This year JAXConf was held in Santa Clara, the heart of silicon valley. The conference once again had a fantastic line up of speakers, with well recognized industry leaders speaking on a variety of current and exciting topics. Unfortunately, JAX continued this year to be one of the best kept secrets of the tech industry on the West coast, with attendance not being as strong as many would have liked.</description>

      <description>JAXConf 2013   I will be returning to speak at JAXConf again this year. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking on the topic of Poly-framework Web applications with Java EE. The session will further explore the ideas I presented in my Polyglot Widgets blog, where I demoed a sample application written using three different web frameworks, demonstrating both a consistent look &amp;amp; feel, and uniform server-side programming model.
This topic will be particularly useful for those JAX attendees that have existing applications in production, yet like what they see with new web technologies and frameworks that they will learn about while attending JAXConf.</description>

      <description>JAX Conf 2012   RichFaces represented at the &amp;ldquo;2012 JAX conference&amp;rdquo;:http://jaxconf.com/2012/ in San Francisco this week. I presented three times on two JSF topics. The conference was overall a great success in my opinion - while not the most highly attended conference at which I&amp;rsquo;ve presented, those that attended were highly engaged and happy to have such direct access to the speakers.
Indeed this was one of my preferred aspects to JAX conf.</description>

      <description>I just returned from an excellent trip to the &amp;ldquo;Red Hat Summit/JBoss World&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/ in Boston. The event was fantastic, kicking off with a great &amp;ldquo;keynote&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/keynotes-sessions.html#12345 demoing &amp;ldquo;Drools&amp;rdquo;:http://www.jboss.org/drools/ in a Mobile scenario. Following the keynote were a number of great sessions, including one I presented on the topic of &amp;ldquo;Mobile RichFaces Applications&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#187.
The session was well received, with some good discussion afterwards. In the session I motivated mobile web applications as a must-have in today&amp;rsquo;s market - users&amp;rsquo; will want and expect a functional web application even if your native application is better.</description>
