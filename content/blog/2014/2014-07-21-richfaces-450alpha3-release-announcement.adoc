= RichFaces 4.5.0.Alpha3 Release Announcement

image::/img/blog/common/richfaces.png[RichFaces, float="right", link="http://richfaces.org/"]

We have a feature complete release of RichFaces 4.5 available with the release of RichFaces https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12324013[4.5.0.Alpha3].  This is a full framework release with RichFaces 4.5.0.Alpha3, whereas previous 4.5 Alpha releases consisted of just the components.  We've back-ported many of the improvements from RichFaces 5 Alphas into this release, while maintaining backward compatibility with the RichFaces 4.3 branch.

[.alert.alert-info]
*To try out this release:* You can download the distribution http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones[directly], or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.5.0.Alpha3. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces4x[getting started guide].

== Release Highlights
Significant improvements in this RichFaces 4.5.0.Alpha3 release over previous 4.3 releases include:

* JSF 2.2 compatibility
* Our replacement Extended PartialViewContext (PVC) that extends the JSF PVC (for better interoperability with other JSF-based frameworks)
* A re-vamped build consisting of a single (multi-module) repository
* Chart components developed as part of last year's GSoC
* The updated JSF 2.2 compatible RichFaces Fileupload component
* A type-safe approach for attribute definitions (using interfaces rather than xml)
* Page fragments for abstracting your functional tests
* An simplified Asciidoc version of the docs

== Next steps

With RichFaces 4.5.0.Alpha3 being feature complete we will proceed with a series of stabilizing Betas, followed by CR and Final releases in the end-of-summer / early-fall time-frame.  The post 4.5.0 story is a bit more complicated, and deserving of link:/blog/2014/07/richfaces-will-pursue-stability-over-innovation.html[it's own post].
