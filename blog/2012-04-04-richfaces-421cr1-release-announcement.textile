title: "RichFaces 4.2.1.CR1 Release Announcement"
tags: [ RF42, RichFaces ]
---

We've released RichFaces <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310341&version=12319019">4.2.1.CR1</a> - the first candidate release for the first 4.2 micro release. This release comes with initial support for rapid component development with the CDK and jRebel, and a new archetype demonstrating (among other things) a mobile RichFaces application,. For the most part however, this release focuses on bug-fixes and stability of the components and framework.

To try out this release, you can download the distribution<a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download/milestones"> directly</a>, or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.xml to 4.2.1.CR1. For more information on setting up a RichFaces 4 application, refer to our<a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GettingstartedwithRichFaces4x"> getting started guide</a>.

h3. Kitchensink Example

Since the <a href="http://blog.bleathem.ca/2012/02/richfaces-420final-release-announcement.html">4.2.0.Final</a> release, we've included a new sample application: the RichFaces <a href="https://github.com/richfaces/as-quickstarts">kitchensink quickstart</a> (also available as an <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22richfaces-archetype-kitchensink%22">archetype</a>). This is example application demonstrates key pieces of the Java EE stack, with a JSF/RichFaces frontend. We have it currently <a href="http://kitchensink-richfaces.rhcloud.com/">deployed to openshift</a> if you want to see it in action. Be sure to check out this example with your mobile phone, to see the kind of mobile application you can build with RichFaces (complete with client side validation, and ajax push!)

h3. Rapid component Development

Another new initiative that made its way into this release is the work we've been doing to support rapid component development with the <a href="https://community.jboss.org/wiki/RichFacesCDKHowTos">CDK</a> and <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/">jRebel</a>. We've included the necessary jRebel configuration in our component projects (<a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-12090">RF-12090</a>) to enable jRebel to hot reload the classes generated by the CDK. See <a href="http://rik-ansikter.blogspot.ca/2012/03/incredibly-fast-jsf-component.html">Lukas' blog post</a> for details on how you can get this working seamlessly within eclipse with <a href="http://www.jboss.org/tools">JBoss tools</a>.

h3. Next steps

Our crack-QE team has uncovered some regression in the CR1 release with their extensive test suite. We'll address these issues with the <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF/fixforversion/12319306">4.2.1.Final</a> release, but be sure to give the CR1 release a spin to check for any issues we may have overlooked. Of course, concurrent to this micro release, we're hard at work on some brand new stuff for RichFaces 4.3 (see the relevant <a href="https://community.jboss.org/thread/175973">planning discussion</a> for details).
