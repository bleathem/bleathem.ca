Last week I was at "Java One":http://www.oracle.com/javaone/, where I can easily say I thoroughly enjoyed the week of chaos that is JavaOne.  The quality of people and content was truly astounding - I met a number of people I'd been wanting to meet for a while, and also spent some time getting to know more fellow JBoss developers.  I spent the bulk of my time preparing my presentations, leaving little time to attend sessions.  Hopefully this extra effort paid off ;)

h2. JBoss Booth Sessions.

The first talk I gave was an impromptu one, filling in a last-minute vacancy in the schedule.  I delivered a trimmed down version of the "Mobile JSF":http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/richfaces-mobile.html talk I gave at JBW and "JAX":http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2012/07/jax-conf-2012.html last June/July.  The talk was well received, "trapping" a fair amount of traffic around the booth, and resulting in some interesting discussion at the end of the session.  The "slides from this session":http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/richfaces-mobile.html are available, and the session was filmed - I'll follow up with links when the videos are available.

My second talk was also a booth session.  This time I presented on "Leveraging jQuery plugins to build JSF components":http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/jsf-components.html.  This talk demonstrates how to build custom JSF components using first the JSF 2 composite component feature, then the RichFaces CDK.  Unfortunately this session was less well attended, which I think had a lot to do with the early morning-timing.

h2. JavaOne Session

Finally I presented a JavaOne session with "Lincoln Baxter III":https://twitter.com/lincolnthree on the topic of _"Testing JSF Applications with Arquillian and Selenium":https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7622._  This slide was recorded, and the videos is available for "online viewing":http://blueskybd.vo.llnwd.net/o16/oracle/CON7622_mp4_7622_001.html.  Additionally I've "posted the slides":http://www.bleathem.ca/talks/2012-JavaOne/testing-jsf.html on my website, and the "source code used for the demos":https://github.com/bleathem/TestingJSF is available on github.

The JavaOne session went really well.  I was not expecting the audience to be so unfamiliar with Arquillian, given how many times "Arquillian was presented at JavaOne":https://plus.google.com/114112334290393746697/posts/23Zg6PHnJpr.  As such we spent more time going over the Arquillian Basics, and this cut quite a bit into the time I wanted to spend on the JSF specific Arquillian Warp slides near the end of the presentation.  Nevertheless, the message was well received, and we've successfully seeded the brains of a number of JSF developers with thoughts of testing with Arquillian.

Of course one can't mention JavaOne without talking about the "Oracle Appreciation Event":http://www.oracle.com/us/appreciation-event-experience-1734940.html.  Words cannot express how _supremely awesome_ it was to see Pearl Jam perform live!  Larry Ellison's going to have a tough time topping that next year!

All in all, I'd call the event a success.  I'll definitely be submitting a session abstract again next year!
