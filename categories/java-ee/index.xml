      <description>For more than a decade now, JavaServer Faces (JSF) has held a special place as the sole portion of the JavaEE specification that addresses building UI&amp;#8217;s for our web applications. As such JSF has historically been the only web front-end we&amp;#8217;ve pushed at JBoss. Along with Seam and later CDI, RichFaces has been an important part of our JSF story, and a vehicle for our innovation in the JSF space.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m thrilled to be speaking the upcoming DevNation conference. DevNation is an Open Source Developer conference co-located with the Red Hat Summit. With the announced agenda and the co-location with Summit, the conference is shaping up to be quite the event!
 I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking about developing widgets with the jQuery UI widget factory. We&amp;#8217;ll look at how the widget factory takes away much of the boiler plate when writing stateful jQuery plug-ins, statefulness that comes intrinsically when creating visual plug-ins.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s feedback time! Developers today are presented with an abundance of options when selecting which technologies will form the basis of their applications. Even if we constrain ourselves to the presentation tier, that choices available are staggering. Technology providers then get to play the fun game of anticipating in which direction its users and customers are headed and make sure they are providing them with value.
 To help us at JBoss better understand in which direction you are headed with your applications of today and tomorrow, we have prepared a quick 3-question survey on Presentation Tier technologies.</description>

      <description>With RichFaces 5 we have made a significant change to our documentation tool-chain with the introduction of AsciiDoc to simplify the task of authoring and editing the RichFaces documentation. Our documentation has for a long time been based on Docbook xml against which we have applied the Red Hat PressGang XSLT to create the HTML and PDF output of our docs.
 Additionally the Docbook xml is fed downstream into Red Hat&amp;#8217;s Web Framework Kit product (WFK), where it undergoes further transformations to fit well into Red Hat&amp;#8217;s product documentation.</description>

Unfortunately, JAX continued this year to be one of the best kept secrets of the tech industry on the West coast, with attendance not being as strong as many would have liked.</description>

      <description>JAXConf 2013   I will be returning to speak at JAXConf again this year. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking on the topic of Poly-framework Web applications with Java EE. The session will further explore the ideas I presented in my Polyglot Widgets blog, where I demoed a sample application written using three different web frameworks, demonstrating both a consistent look &amp;amp; feel, and uniform server-side programming model.
This topic will be particularly useful for those JAX attendees that have existing applications in production, yet like what they see with new web technologies and frameworks that they will learn about while attending JAXConf.</description>

      <description>RichFaces   With the imminent 4.3.0.Final release of RichFaces, we will be providing developers with the ability to dynamically create &amp;lt;rich:togglePanel&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rich:accordion&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;rich:tabPanel&amp;gt; panel items dynamically with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag.
&amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; vs. &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; Creating the above panels from a backing bean list has always been possible with RichFaces 4 using the JSTL &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; tag, so why have we bothered adding support for creating such panels with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag?</description>

      <description>JBoss Developer Framework   The JBoss JDF project shows Java EE developers how to build state-of-the-art applications using the JBoss implementations of the Java EE stack. Specifically, the JDF View Frameworks section identifies a number of alternative approaches one can take when developing the view layer of your application. We in the RichFaces project have been working towards better supporting this effort by redesigning our JSF component architecture to allow the javascript part of our components (what we call our &amp;ldquo;widgets&amp;rdquo;) to be used independent of JSF, either in a standalone manner or coupled with another web framework.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the buzz the RichFaces Bootstrap sandbox initiative is generating. It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting to see other projects offer a bootstrap style/theme. This can only help inter-op and component compatibility, marking life easier for all JSF developers. This post is meant to help those looking to build a custom application using the RichFaces Bootstrap components.
Along with the new approach we are taking in the development of these new components, the RichFaces project is incorporating a new LESS based approach to style/themes.</description>

Following the keynote were a number of great sessions, including one I presented on the topic of &amp;ldquo;Mobile RichFaces Applications&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#187.
The session was well received, with some good discussion afterwards. In the session I motivated mobile web applications as a must-have in today&amp;rsquo;s market - users&amp;rsquo; will want and expect a functional web application even if your native application is better.</description>

      <description>With a RichFaces 4.1.0.Final release on the horizon, now is a good time to talk about the future of the project. Let me start by announcing that I will be taking over from Jay Balunas as lead of the RichFaces project. Jay has been a long-time shepherd of RichFaces from within JBoss, and has had a direct hand in making the project such a great success. Jay has been a terrific mentor and while he is stepping down as the project lead, he will continue to stay involved, sharing his insight and experience with the Richfaces team.</description>

      <description>We are announcing the release of RichFaces 4.1.0.CR2, a second release candidate for RichFaces 4.1. We had a couple of regressions that were introduced in the 4.1.0.CR1 release that we’ve addressed in the with this CR2 release. The expectation is that CR2 will be re-tagged and released as 4.1.0.Final, provided no blocking issues are found. Our QE team has done a great job running their test suite against this release, but I encourage as many community members as possible to download the CR2 release, and make sure it’s “up to snuff”!</description>

      <description>Following on with another entry in my CDK series, this time we will look at at creating a pair of components to wrap the jQuery UI tabs plugin with the RichFaces CDK. It&amp;rsquo;ll take two components to accomplish this; one component to define the tab container, and another to define the tabs themselves. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in with a look at the Abstract component definitions.

      <description>I’m excited to announce the availability of RichFaces4.1.0.CR1, the first release candidate for RichFaces 4.1.0. Stability of the platform has been a strong focus for all the RichFaces 4.1.0 milestone releases, and has been even more so of a focus for our CR1 release.
We really appreciate the community feedback we’ve received throughout the 4.1 development cycle, with each of the milestone releases. The bugs found and the suggestions provided from the community have really helped us nail down this release.</description>

      <description>The RichFaces 4.1 Milestone 4 release is now available for download! With this M4 release we focused on stabilizing the features we introduced in the earlier 4.1 release-train milestones (M1, M2, M3). The release following M4 will be our 4.1 release candidate, so we want to make sure we achieve maximum stability with M4. Some of the key areas we touched are listed below.
If your keen and want to get started right away, you can download the distribution directly, or for maven users, increment the RichFaces version in your pom.</description>

Further building on the new components and framework improvements introduced in the M1 and M2 releases, M3 brings it all together with an improved showcase - featuring a demonstration of the mobile compatibility of the RichFaces 4 component set. Along-side improvements to resource handling, and enhancements to the push component, we’ve fixed a number of bugs and issues, as voted by you - our user community!</description>

      <description>Further incrementing the complexity over the input component we created previously, this time we will create a JSF calendar component. Being pragmatic OSS developers, we will leverage the existing javascript of the datepicker component from the jQuery UI project, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see how well the RichFaces CDK lends itself to mapping JSF component attributes into javascript configuration options.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a recipe I found useful for trouble-shooting a web-app over an SSL connection. The steps involved are to:
Set the server name/IP on each of the testing machines (both Windows and Linux) Create a self-signed certificate for the server using the java-based keytool Export the certificate for installation as a CA in the clients Configure JBoss AS7 to use the certificate sotre All the above steps are sufficiently simple, but each required it&amp;rsquo;s own share of googling to get everything just right.</description>

      <description>With our last component, we saw how we could output some simple text with a custom JSF component created with the RichFaces CDK. Let&amp;rsquo;s increment the complexity, and see how we can create a component that accepts input. Again, the goal here is to highlight how the important features fit together, and to leverage as much of the plumbing work as possible from the RichFaces CDK.

      <description>The Richfaces 4.1 milestone releases are trucking along. With M1, we had a focus on changes surrounding project infrastructure, and the introduction of some new components. Now with M2 we see updates to the core, and a stabilization of both the new components and the framework as a whole.
jQuery Upgrade We built the RichFaces 4 components using jQuery for DOM manipulation. Given the degree to which the we rely on jQuery, upgrading it is a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Starting real simple, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a component that produces a hello world output. &amp;ldquo;Why start with a hello world? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a little cliche?&amp;rdquo;. Well indeed it is, but it is by far the best way to point out the fundamental pieces of the CDK, and how they together. We&amp;rsquo;ll build a strong foundation in our understanding of the CDK, on which we can build more interesting components in future posts.</description>

Whether you have your own itch you want to scratch, a long-standing bug you want to see resolved, or implement a new feature altogether, we&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of low hanging fruit ripe for the picking!
In preparation for the hack-a-thon, I&amp;rsquo;ve given the Seam Faces JIRA issues a once-over.</description>

Over the next few weeks, I am going to put out a series of blog posts giving some examples of how to use the RichFaces CDK. Hopefully by the end of this series, we will have written some interesting components and left you with the urge to write your own JSF components using the CDK!</description>

Great news, Seam Faces 3.0.2.Final has been released! It is available for download via the JBoss Nexus repository. Primarily a bug fix release, Seam Faces 3.0.2.Final resolves some compatibility issues with MyFaces, thanks to contributions from Christian Kaltepoth. Additionally, José Freitas has contributed some fixes to issues with the UIInputContainer. A full list of the bugs fixed is available here.
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about the community involvement in this release, and with more community members coming forward with features they&amp;rsquo;d like to see implemented/improved.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post, as I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a significant career change. I am now working for Red Hat, as a core developer on the RichFaces project. I am also representing Red hat on the JSR-344: JSF 2.2 Expert Group, and will continue in my role as Seam Faces module lead.
As such, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting at JAXConf/JSF Summit on the topic of Seam Faces. I really like this presentation, as I not only go into the features provided by Seam Faces, but I show how some of those features are implemented taking advantage of the platform extension points built into CDI and JSF.</description>

In this entry for the Seam Module Spotlight series, we will take a close look at the “view configuration” feature of Seam Faces.
Seam Faces aims to provide JSF developers with a truly worthy framework for web development by ironing out some of JSF’s pain points, integrating tightly with CDI, and offering out of the box integration with the other Seam Modules and third party libraries.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet heard about it, JBoss Forge is a fantastic new tool from JBoss for rapid application development of standards based applications. Forge allows a developer to quickly set up the scaffolding for an application, and quickly get to the matter of solving domain problems.
What makes Forge particularly interesting, from my perspective, is the way it was built with plugins in mind as a defining way in which the platform is meant to be extended.</description>

      <description>In Seam Faces we&amp;rsquo;ve provided JSF developers with a mechanism to centrally configure various aspects of their JSF views. Concerns like transaction control and view security are currently supported, and support for URL rewriting, XSRF attack prevention, and JSF navigation is in the planning stage.
The end-goal is to support view configuration via multiple sources (including some support for &amp;lt;f:metadata&amp;gt; child tags). For now we provide type-safe configuration using annotations on enums.</description>

      <description>Like any piece of software, Weld, the reference implementation for JSR-299, is continually improving as bugs are discovered, and performance is optimized. However, since Weld is tightly coupled with your application server of choice, using the latest weld is slightly more complicated than just bundling a weld release with your web application. This post outlines the relatively painless process of updating the Weld implementation of Glassfish 3.1 to use the latest SNAPSHOT, or any later release for that matter.</description>

      <description>JSF 2 introduced the ability to create RESTful URLs with the introduction of the &amp;lt;f:viewParam&amp;gt; tag. The tag is easy enough to use, you simply place it in the &amp;lt;f:metadate&amp;gt; tag, and configure the attributes to decode the url.
&amp;lt;f:metadata&amp;gt; &amp;lt;f:viewParam /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/f:metadata&amp;gt;  There are no words to explain how great a feature this is for JSF. The old &amp;ldquo;every request is a POST&amp;rdquo; theory didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out. RESTful URLs are bookmarkable, and meaningful to end-users.</description>

      <description>At first the conversation scope introduced with CDI seemed like it would be incredibly useful. Unfortunately, working with conversations ended up being more difficult than expected. Details of why this is, is fodder for another post.
I ended up often using the JSF ViewScope, exposed as a CDI scope though the Seam Faces CDI extension. When used in conjunction with JSF viewParams to propagate information between pages, the result is a book-markable end user experience.</description>

      <description>CDI is the new programming model introduced with Java EE 6. An acronym for Contexts and Dependency Injection, CDI advertises well two of the programming paradigms it aims to solve. But there is another, often overlooked sibling: Event handling. While I&amp;rsquo;d heard it mentioned in the context of CDI, I&amp;rsquo;d never really paid much attention - I was probably too busy trying to wrap my head around Conversations, and how CDI provides Dependency Injection.</description>

      <description>Call me eager, call me insane, I had a JavaEE 6 app up and running in production on Glassfish 3.0 one month after it&amp;rsquo;s release. The improvements in JSF 2 and CDI were too compelling for me to hold off adopting, and sure enough, the application was quick and painless to develop.
I did however pay a price for being an early adopter - a Glassfish / Weld bug was preventing my JSF login pages from working.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve jumped on the JavaEE 6 bandwagon, with one application already in production. The developer productivity improvements in JavaEE6/Glassfish V3 are tremendous. The only downside is that I still have some JavaEE 5 applications in production. The JavaEE 5 apps can&amp;rsquo;t migrate to JavaEE 6 until Icefaces supports JSF 1.2.
One workaround to this is to bundle the JSF 1.2 implementation with your application, then configure the classloader using the sun-web.</description>
