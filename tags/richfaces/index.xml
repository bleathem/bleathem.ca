      <description>For more than a decade now, JavaServer Faces (JSF) has held a special place as the sole portion of the JavaEE specification that addresses building UI&amp;#8217;s for our web applications. As such JSF has historically been the only web front-end we&amp;#8217;ve pushed at JBoss. Along with Seam and later CDI, RichFaces has been an important part of our JSF story, and a vehicle for our innovation in the JSF space.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s feedback time! Developers today are presented with an abundance of options when selecting which technologies will form the basis of their applications. Even if we constrain ourselves to the presentation tier, that choices available are staggering. Technology providers then get to play the fun game of anticipating in which direction its users and customers are headed and make sure they are providing them with value.
 To help us at JBoss better understand in which direction you are headed with your applications of today and tomorrow, we have prepared a quick 3-question survey on Presentation Tier technologies.</description>

      <description>With RichFaces 5 we have made a significant change to our documentation tool-chain with the introduction of AsciiDoc to simplify the task of authoring and editing the RichFaces documentation. Our documentation has for a long time been based on Docbook xml against which we have applied the Red Hat PressGang XSLT to create the HTML and PDF output of our docs.
 Additionally the Docbook xml is fed downstream into Red Hat&amp;#8217;s Web Framework Kit product (WFK), where it undergoes further transformations to fit well into Red Hat&amp;#8217;s product documentation.</description>

      <description>RichFaces   With the imminent 4.3.0.Final release of RichFaces, we will be providing developers with the ability to dynamically create &amp;lt;rich:togglePanel&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;rich:accordion&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;rich:tabPanel&amp;gt; panel items dynamically with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag.
&amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; vs. &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; Creating the above panels from a backing bean list has always been possible with RichFaces 4 using the JSTL &amp;lt;c:forEach&amp;gt; tag, so why have we bothered adding support for creating such panels with the &amp;lt;a4j:repeat&amp;gt; tag?</description>

      <description>RichFaces   The first candidate release of RichFaces 4.3 (4.3.0.CR1) has been released. This release candidate for the RichFaces 4.3 release doesn&amp;rsquo;t add any new features, rather it polishes, documents, and showcases the many new features added in the earlier 4.3 milestones (4.3.0.M3, 4.3.0.M2, 4.3.0.M1).

      <description>JBoss Developer Framework   The JBoss JDF project shows Java EE developers how to build state-of-the-art applications using the JBoss implementations of the Java EE stack. Specifically, the JDF View Frameworks section identifies a number of alternative approaches one can take when developing the view layer of your application. We in the RichFaces project have been working towards better supporting this effort by redesigning our JSF component architecture to allow the javascript part of our components (what we call our &amp;ldquo;widgets&amp;rdquo;) to be used independent of JSF, either in a standalone manner or coupled with another web framework.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the buzz the RichFaces Bootstrap sandbox initiative is generating. It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting to see other projects offer a bootstrap style/theme. This can only help inter-op and component compatibility, marking life easier for all JSF developers. This post is meant to help those looking to build a custom application using the RichFaces Bootstrap components.
Along with the new approach we are taking in the development of these new components, the RichFaces project is incorporating a new LESS based approach to style/themes.</description>

The conference was overall a great success in my opinion - while not the most highly attended conference at which I&amp;rsquo;ve presented, those that attended were highly engaged and happy to have such direct access to the speakers.
Indeed this was one of my preferred aspects to JAX conf.</description>

      <description>I just returned from an excellent trip to the &amp;ldquo;Red Hat Summit/JBoss World&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/ in Boston. The event was fantastic, kicking off with a great &amp;ldquo;keynote&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/keynotes-sessions.html#12345 demoing &amp;ldquo;Drools&amp;rdquo;:http://www.jboss.org/drools/ in a Mobile scenario. Following the keynote were a number of great sessions, including one I presented on the topic of &amp;ldquo;Mobile RichFaces Applications&amp;rdquo;:http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html#187.
The session was well received, with some good discussion afterwards. In the session I motivated mobile web applications as a must-have in today&amp;rsquo;s market - users&amp;rsquo; will want and expect a functional web application even if your native application is better.</description>

      <description>RichFaces4.2.2.Final is available, the second RichFaces 4.2 micro release. This release was originally intended to focus on changes required to better align with the upcoming JBoss AS 7.1.2 release. However we had some community members step forward with some fixes, and those contributions ended up turning this release into a reasonable bug fix release!
I would like to give a big shout out to Luca Nardelli, Adrian Gonzalez, and Jason Porter.</description>

The RichFaces community effort centres around providing a set of first-class JSF components built using these Bootstrap widgets via the RichFaces CDK.</description>

Let me start by announcing that I will be taking over from Jay Balunas as lead of the RichFaces project. Jay has been a long-time shepherd of RichFaces from within JBoss, and has had a direct hand in making the project such a great success. Jay has been a terrific mentor and while he is stepping down as the project lead, he will continue to stay involved, sharing his insight and experience with the Richfaces team.</description>

We had a couple of regressions that were introduced in the 4.1.0.CR1 release that we’ve addressed in the with this CR2 release. The expectation is that CR2 will be re-tagged and released as 4.1.0.Final, provided no blocking issues are found. Our QE team has done a great job running their test suite against this release, but I encourage as many community members as possible to download the CR2 release, and make sure it’s “up to snuff”!</description>

      <description>Following on with another entry in my CDK series, this time we will look at at creating a pair of components to wrap the jQuery UI tabs plugin with the RichFaces CDK. It&amp;rsquo;ll take two components to accomplish this; one component to define the tab container, and another to define the tabs themselves. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in with a look at the Abstract component definitions.

We really appreciate the community feedback we’ve received throughout the 4.1 development cycle, with each of the milestone releases. The bugs found and the suggestions provided from the community have really helped us nail down this release.</description>

      <description>Further incrementing the complexity over the input component we created previously, this time we will create a JSF calendar component. Being pragmatic OSS developers, we will leverage the existing javascript of the datepicker component from the jQuery UI project, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see how well the RichFaces CDK lends itself to mapping JSF component attributes into javascript configuration options.

      <description>With our last component, we saw how we could output some simple text with a custom JSF component created with the RichFaces CDK. Let&amp;rsquo;s increment the complexity, and see how we can create a component that accepts input. Again, the goal here is to highlight how the important features fit together, and to leverage as much of the plumbing work as possible from the RichFaces CDK.

      <description>The Richfaces 4.1 milestone releases are trucking along. With M1, we had a focus on changes surrounding project infrastructure, and the introduction of some new components. Now with M2 we see updates to the core, and a stabilization of both the new components and the framework as a whole.
jQuery Upgrade We built the RichFaces 4 components using jQuery for DOM manipulation. Given the degree to which the we rely on jQuery, upgrading it is a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>RichFaces 4 CDK | Hello World</title>

      <description>This is the first technical post of my CDK series. Starting real simple, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a component that produces a hello world output. &amp;ldquo;Why start with a hello world? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a little cliche?&amp;rdquo;. Well indeed it is, but it is by far the best way to point out the fundamental pieces of the CDK, and how they together. We&amp;rsquo;ll build a strong foundation in our understanding of the CDK, on which we can build more interesting components in future posts.</description>

      <description>A new blog series Having recently dived head first into the RichFaces 4 Component development Kit (CDK), I thought it would be useful to share the knowledge and experience I&amp;rsquo;ve gained. Over the next few weeks, I am going to put out a series of blog posts giving some examples of how to use the RichFaces CDK. Hopefully by the end of this series, we will have written some interesting components and left you with the urge to write your own JSF components using the CDK!</description>

      <title>RichFaces Plugin for JBoss Forge</title>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet heard about it, JBoss Forge is a fantastic new tool from JBoss for rapid application development of standards based applications. Forge allows a developer to quickly set up the scaffolding for an application, and quickly get to the matter of solving domain problems.
What makes Forge particularly interesting, from my perspective, is the way it was built with plugins in mind as a defining way in which the platform is meant to be extended.</description>
