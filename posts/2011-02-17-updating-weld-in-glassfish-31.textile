title: "Updating Weld in Glassfish 3.1"
---

Like any piece of software, <a href="http://seamframework.org/Weld">Weld</a>, the reference implementation for <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">JSR-299</a>, is continually improving as bugs are discovered, and performance is optimized.&nbsp; However, since Weld is tightly coupled with your application server of choice, using the latest weld is slightly more complicated than just bundling a weld release with your web application.&nbsp; This post outlines the relatively painless process of updating the Weld implementation of Glassfish 3.1 to use the latest SNAPSHOT, or any later release for that matter.



A quick search of the Glassfish folder structure identifies the Weld implementation:

<pre class="code brush: bash">$ find /opt/sun/glassfish/ -iname '*weld*'
/opt/sun/glassfish/glassfish/modules/weld-integration-fragment.jar
/opt/sun/glassfish/glassfish/modules/weld-integration.jar
/opt/sun/glassfish/glassfish/modules/weld-osgi-bundle.jar
</pre>

The weld-osgi-bundle.jar is the file we have to replace.  But how does one go about creating such an OSGI bundle?  I for one am not an OSGI expert, and I'm sure I'm not alone :P



<hr/>Update: The Weld OSGI bundle is now published to the maven repository.&nbsp; Instead of building it yourself, you can download it via: <style type="text/css">
p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }
</style> 

<div style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><a href="https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/weld/weld-osgi-bundle/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/"><span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jboss/weld/weld-osgi-bundle/1.1.0-SNAPSHOT/</span></a></div><hr/>Not to worry, the weld guys have this in hand.  The OSGI bundle is built as an artifact during the weld build.  To begin, proceed to the<a href="https://github.com/weld/core"> Weld core github page</a>,&nbsp; and checkout the project:

<pre class="code brush: bash">git clone https://github.com/weld/core.git
cd core
</pre>

I had a bit of trouble building the entire project, due to the requirement of some <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers">deprecated artifacts</a>.  So just build the impl module in core:

<pre class="code brush: bash">cd impl
mvn clean install
</pre>

Next, build the OSGI bundle:

<pre class="code brush: bash">cd ../bundles/osgi/
mvn clean install
</pre>

Now take that newly created Weld OSGI bundle, and use it to replace the Glassfish weld-osgi-bundle.jar file we located earlier.

<pre class="code brush: bash">cp target/weld-osgi-bundle-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /opt/sun/glassfish/glassfish/modules/weld-osgi-bundle.jar
</pre>

Restart Glassfish, and you should see a message in the log file along the lines of:

<pre class="code brush: bash">INFO: Updated bundle 75 from /opt/sun/glassfish-3.1-b41/glassfish/modules/weld-osgi-bundle.jar
</pre>

And there you have it, Glassfish 3.1 running with the latest Weld.&nbsp; Thanks to Stuart Douglas who guided me through the process!



Note: this will not work to get Weld 1.1+ to run on Glassfish 3.0.1, as the interface between Glassfish and Weld changed considerably with Weld 1.1/Glassfish 3.1.  However that interface is for the most part stable, so we can use newer releases of Weld on Glassfish 3.1.
